# Lifeycle Inveseting
Lifecycle investing is leveraging your stock allocation while young to diversify over time. The diversification benefits could be spent on higher returns,
lower variance, or some of both.

This repo replicates the excel sheets found [here](https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/data.html). These sheets come from the book _Lifecycle Investing_
by Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff. See [here](https://www.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Investing-Audacious-Performance-Retirement-ebook/dp/B003GYEGK2).
